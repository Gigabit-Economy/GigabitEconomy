## Branch policy
**No commits should be made directly to main branch.**

- Commit to a feature branch *(feature/[name])* and then open a pull request once functionality is complete.
- Remember to make clear commit messages and add comments and updated to the GitHub issues when appropriate
- Do not independently push / merge to main without having your code reviewed
- Remember to interact with and update the issue pages. This helps keep a clear log of progress.

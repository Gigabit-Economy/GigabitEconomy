You are a delivery driver aiming to do your round. Deliver to all the houses you can without falling victim to the dangers of suburbia.
If worse comes to worst, you can always borrow whatever happens to lie inside your parcels for a helping hand.
Just remember in the Gigabit Economy the deliveries you make (and the ones you don't) affect the score your company gives you at the end of the day.
